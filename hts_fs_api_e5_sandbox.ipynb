The HVAC rep business represents manufacturers\\nand suppliers for commercial and industrial heating, cooling and temperature control\\nsystems. KORE provides the rep business with an ERP – enterprise resource planning –\\nsystem called TRAX that is specifically designed for the HVAC rep industry. TRAX provides\\nan organization’s resources with the tools needed to plan and manage the business so the\\ncompany can focus on its core business of revenue generation, brand promotion,\\nresources management and achieving the corporate vision.\\nTRAX is a web-based tool used to manage the daily work of engineers and sales reps, to\\ntrack equipment and to help the HVAC rep business become more competitive in the\\nmarketplace by standardizing business processes. This tool is being used for project\\nmanagement as well as an end-to-end business application platform that covers all\\nactivities of the rep business as a full-service custom HVAC provider – starting from\\nchasing a potential sale, winning a bid, shipping and handling, managing product\\ninventories, billing, and other accounting and financial activities.\\nThis user guide has a comprehensive structure that advises an application user on the\\nfollowing:\\n\\uf0b7 Understanding TRAX UI components and navigation\\n\\uf0b7 Key stakeholders and their roles from a business perspective\\n\\uf0b7 Company’s business workflows and functions\\n\\uf0b7 Job and bill structures, bill conversion and project management\\n\\uf0b7 Business Reporting\\n\\uf0b7 Document Management\\n\\uf0b7 TRAXits management\\n\\uf0b7 Accounting and financials\\n\\uf0b7 Application configuration\\nEach functional component is detailed starting with a process flow to explain how various\\ncomponents are tied together. Definitions and characteristics of interrelated parts are then\\ndescribed followed by steps to perform a business function. Screen layouts are provided\\nalongside field descriptions to deliver comprehensive aid to an application user.\\nPage 4\\nJobs User Guide Version 1.1\\nKORE Solutions Last Updated: 13-Jun-2023\\n2 Job Structure and Job Search\\n2.1 Visual Representations of a Job Structure\\nA Job is created to track a potential sale that is being pursued. It is the top level of the job\\nstructure and holds some basic information such as job site, description, contacts and\\nvertical market. A job contains bills, subjobs, and proposals. A bill is a way of grouping\\nsubjobs for quoting.\\nA Proposal helps to manage document control for various pre-bid activities,\\naccommodates job scope changes, and facilitates proposal communication for internal\\nand external contacts. The proposal application unifies various departments with a\\nconsistent approach to pre-bid workflows to provide a coherent methodology and\\napproach for internal and external stakeholders.\\nJob\\nA job can be created with one or more bill(s)/proposal(s).\\nJob\\nBill 1\\nMECH\\nBill 2\\nHYDR\\nBill 3\\nSMET\\nProposal 1\\nMECH\\nProposal 2\\nHYDR\\nDiagram 1 – A job contains Bill(s) and Proposal(s)\\nA Department is a division of a company dealing with a specific subject such as\\nMechanical or Controls Sales.\\nA Subjob contains all the costing and scope of work description for a particular\\ndepartment or area of a bid. A subjob can have one or more section(s). Sample\\ndepartments – subjobs are MECH CRAC Units, CTRL Design, and HYDR Pumps.\\nPage 5\\nJobs User Guide Version 1.1\\nKORE Solutions Last Updated: 13-Jun-2023\\nA Section is derived from a spec and is typically a spec section for a bid or a spec job. A\\nsection can have one or more items.\\nAn Item is a piece of equipment that we are selling or has been sold. It is where costs are\\nassociated with a section. An item may/may not have deliverable tags.\\nTags for a product are taken from shop drawings and different size, capacity, equipment\\nwill have different tags for the same product. Once a bill is converted to a project,\\ndeliverables get created from tags on an item within the sections. When a purchase is\\nsubmitted to a supplier for a piece of equipment that has been sold, a deliverable is\\nattached to a purchase order. A project manager manages the deliverable until it is\\nshipped to the customer site and billed. An item needs to be marked Inactive if the scope\\nhas changed.\\nA Bill of material (BOM) or simply a bill is a scope of work that is being quoted. A bill is a\\npart of a job that we are pursuing – a way to group subjobs. For example, a bill can cover\\nequipment on a section of a floor or on different floors. A bill can have one or more\\nsubjob(s). Conversely, a subjob can be attached to one or more bills as shown by the red\\narrows connecting subjobs to bills. A subjob can have multiple sections to group different\\ntypes of equipment. A section contains one or more item(s). It may contain a piece of\\nequipment or a startup/quarterly maintenance service that is sold to compliment the\\nequipment sale.\\nPage 6\\nJobs User Guide Version 1.1\\nKORE Solutions Last Updated: 13-Jun-2023\\nSubjob 1 Section 1 Item 1\\nMECH AHU Air handler\\nSection 2\\nItem 2\\nChiller\\nSubjob 2 Pre-heat\\nCTRL coils\\nBill 1\\nSection 3\\nMECH\\nFan coils\\nSubjob 3\\nHYDR\\nBill 2\\nHYDR\\nSubjob 4\\nSMET\\nBill 3\\nSMET\\nSubjob 5\\nISOL\\nSubjob 6\\nHYDR\\nDiagram 2 – Bill, Subjob, Section, and Item Relationships\\nA bill can also have one or more bids in the tender phase as shown by the green arrows.\\nBids are sent to bidders (aka subcontractors) for consideration. A bill that has been won\\nin a bidding process gets marked as WON and it gets converted to a project. The bill is\\nthen set to inactive status. There can only be one successful bidder.\\nA Converted Bill becomes a Project where a project manager plans for the\\ndeliverables to be transported to a construction site. A bill can also be appended to an\\nexisting project as long as all converted bills are on the same job.\\nPage 7\\nJobs User Guide Version 1.1\\nKORE Solutions Last Updated: 13-Jun-2023\\nBill 1\\nBid 1\\nMECH\\nMECH\\nBid 2\\nMECH\\nBid 3\\nMECH\\nBill 2\\nBid 1 HYDR\\nHYDR\\nBid 2\\nHYDR\\nDiagram 3 – Bill to bid relationship\\nPage 8\\nJobs User Guide Version 1.1\\nKORE Solutions Last Updated: 13-Jun-2023\\n2.2 Description\\nThe HVAC rep business has a membership to a construction association that has a list of\\nall construction jobs. Construction jobs can also be ascertained through established\\nrelationships with sales reps. The archives team and sales leader look at the construction\\nsite for jobs that are approved for construction. If a job is assessed to be a good\\nopportunity, the archives team checks in TRAX if the job exists. If not, a new job is added\\nand specs are entered. The takeoff process is launched for consulting engineers –\\ntypically MECH – to compile the requirements in the specs and determine what\\nequipment is needed. They work closely with designers – architects to do the designs.\\nThe goal is to position the rep company to be in the lead when a job goes to tender (aka\\nbid).\\nAs legislated there needs to be at least 3 bidders for each job. A contractor in the\\nconstruction industry gets contracts approved. There are general contractors and\\nsubcontractors for different construction components e.g. electrical, piping, HVAC,\\nroofing, etc. subcontractors bid on jobs from general contractors.\\n2.3 Process Flows\\nBelow is the typical sequence of activities for the Job creation process. Descriptions and\\nsteps to perform each activity are detailed under each section.\\n1. Search for a Job/Bill/Proposal.\\n2. Add a New Job with a Bill.\\n3. Add a New Bill to an Existing Job.\\n4. Add a Subjob to a Job.\\n5.

It is where costs are associated with a\\nsection. Below are applicable for Equipment type sections when adding a Purchase Order\\nor an Agency Order.\\n1. An item may become a deliverable if we want to track its movement through the\\nprocess and follow a set of tasks to deliver it.\\n2. If an item is set up as a deliverable, it can be created as a single deliverable for\\nrelated items by adding Deliverable Tags to make it easier to manage.\\n3. For an item that represents multiple pieces to be delivered to a customer site, create a\\ntag for each piece. Use the range suffix to specify an item number for a deliverable\\ntag e.g. CH-1, CH2, etc. A deliverable can be split later in the project if required.\\n4. When entering the item, specify the supplier, manufacturer, capacity, and other\\nattributes.\\n2.10.1 Add an Equipment Item\\n\\uf0b7 An item can have one or more deliverable tags.\\n\\uf0b7 Tags should be defined for any equipment that will be shipped to a site and for any\\nitem to appear on the bill of material.\\n\\uf0b7 When a tag is added, Becomes Deliverable checkbox will be checked by default.\\nUncheck Becomes Deliverable box if an item is used to track costs like a service.\\n\\uf0b7 It is not common to add a tag for an item that will not be delivered to a customer.\\nWhen converting an item with Becomes Deliverable box unchecked, the Allow Tag\\nWith No Deliverable checkbox on the Deliverable page must be checked. This is an\\nadded validation to ensure the sales rep/project manager is certain the added tag\\nwill not become a deliverable.\\n\\uf0b7 Simple costs such as non-deliverable items can be carried without tags such as a\\nlump sum for potential problems or money for a factory tour. Typically, they are\\nthings that do not require a shipment or are of a less defined nature.\\n\\uf0b7 To appear on the bill of material, the item MUST have a tag.\\n\\uf0b7 When a tag is added with a prefix and a range of TRAX will calculate the quantity.\\nFor example, Prefix = AHU, Range = 1-4. TRAX will set a quantity of 4. This\\nrepresents four unique deliverables that will likely be split at some point in the\\nproject.\\n\\uf0b7 A tag range does not have to be sequential. Use a comma to separate a break in a\\nrange. For example, straight silencers with a Prefix of SL-03 and a Range of 1-4,7-\\n22,24-32 will have 29 tags (4 + 16 + 9).\\n1. To add an equipment item, select the following from the Job Explorer: Job – Job 123,\\nDept. / S.J. – MECH: 3 DESIGN, Section – 1. Chiller.\\n2. Click to the right of Item.\\nPage 67\\nJobs User Guide Version 1.1\\nKORE Solutions Last Updated: 13-Jun-2023\\n3. The Cost left tab will be displayed. Click for our example with Daikin\\nChiller. Select Agency Order if an item is purchased from a supplier who bills the\\ncustomer. Select Purchase Order if an item is a direct buy/sell where we bill the\\ncustomer.\\n4. Choose a product by entering a Product ID/Description to get a drop-down list of\\nvalues to select from. Alternatively, click on for the Product field. Enter Product\\nID = WMC (Water Cooled Frictionless Centrifugal Chiller).\\nSelecting a product from the product lookup field will auto-fill Description,\\nSupplier, Manufacturer, and Bill text fields.\\nIf an item to be added is not an existing product, leave the product field blank and\\nmanually specify values in the other fields excluding Product. To add an item to the\\nlist of existing Products, contact the Manufacturer Administrator. If there is none, send\\na request to Application Support.\\n5.

Total Capacity - 580 (Enter approximate total capacity e.g. how many tons\\nor CFM for all units.)\\nh. Place – Used to add where the deliverable will go e.g Boiler Room\\ni. Model # - WMC290 (Enter specific model # if known.)\\nPage 69\\nJobs User Guide Version 1.1\\nKORE Solutions Last Updated: 13-Jun-2023\\n8. Add additional deliverable tag(s) if applicable. We split a Deliverable to separate it for\\nshipping, submittal, costing or billing. A deliverable can be created a) with multiple\\nquantities on one tag or b) multiple tags.\\nA) A scenario to specify multiple quantities without a range on a tag is if the quantities\\nare going into one shipment.\\nIf a deliverable is created with multiple quantities on one tag, it can also be split into\\nmultiple deliverables with separate tags. A project manager can then specify which\\ntag(s) will be delivered in each skid for separate shipments. This approach should be\\ntaken if a project manager does not know in advance how the deliverables should be\\ngrouped for shipping and billing.\\nB) If a deliverable is created with multiple quantities on multiple tags. For example, 2\\ntags. It can be split into 2 deliverables and 2 tags by using the [Load Group Split]\\noption. Since the original deliverable has separate tags created with the goal of\\nseparating them into two separate deliverables based on each deliverable tag, there\\nis no need to specify which tag will go into which deliverable. This is a good approach\\nif a project manager knows in advance which tags are to be shipped/billed together.\\nSplitting Deliverables will be detailed under the Project Deliverables section.\\n9. Click . The chiller item will be added with below-cost details.
